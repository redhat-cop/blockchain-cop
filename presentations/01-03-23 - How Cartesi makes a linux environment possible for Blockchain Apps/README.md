# How Cartesi makes a Linux Environment Possible for Blockchain Apps

### Description

Cartesi, The Blockchain OS, is a layer-2 platform for the development and deployment of scalable decentralized applications. Cartesi offers a Linux operating system coupled with a blockchain infrastructure, which allows DApps to be developed in familiar programming languages like Python, c++, SQL and others without the need to write Solidity code.

Cartesiâ€™s core technology relies on its virtual machine that emulates a RISC-V ISA, called the Cartesi Machine. It has been designed to run computationally-intensive decentralized logic off-chain, on a Linux environment. This way, developers can bring their ideas to life in their favorite languages and libraries, without giving up on the solid security guarantees of the blockchain.
