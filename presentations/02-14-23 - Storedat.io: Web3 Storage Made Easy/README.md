# Storedat.io: Web3 storage made easy

By [Narb](narbs91), Software Developer and founder of the Glosseta Foundation

### Description

In this presentation I will give an overview and demo of Storedat: Storedat is a GraphQL API built on top of Web3 storage providers like Arweave and Filecoin. Storedat exists to make decentralized storage more accessible to all by abstracting the web3 away from developer experience and letting people read/write data through a single API in a provider agnostic way. No dealing with wallets, signing transactions, managing private keys, paying transaction costs, and so on. Just plug in and Storedat.
